# ⭐ Featured Recipes System Implemented

## Overview
Implemented a flexible featured recipes system that allows manual curation of homepage featured recipes using a `featured: true` flag in recipe MDX files.

---

## ✅ **What Was Done**

### **1. Added `featured: true` to 6 Recipes**

The following recipes are now featured on the homepage:

1. **Klassisk lasagne med köttfärssås** (`klassisk-lasagne`)
   - Category: Vardagsmat
   - Published: 2024-10-10

2. **Caesarsallad med grillad kyckling** (`caesarsallad-kyckling`)
   - Category: Sallader
   - Published: 2024-10-03

3. **Pad Thai med räkor** (`pad-thai`)
   - Category: Vardagsmat
   - Published: 2024-08-18

4. **Krämig kycklinggryta med curry** (`kycklinggryta-curry`)
   - Category: Grytor & Soppor
   - Published: 2024-09-25

5. **Halloumiburgare med sötpotatispommes** (`halloumiburgare`)
   - Category: Vardagsmat
   - Published: 2024-08-25

6. **Brownies (kladdiga och goda)** (`brownies`)
   - Category: Desserter
   - Published: 2024-08-08

### **2. Updated Homepage Logic** (`src/app/page.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
// Sort recipes by date (most recent first)
const sortedRecipes = [...allRecipes].sort((a, b) => {
  const dateA = new Date(a.publishedAt || 0);
  const dateB = new Date(b.publishedAt || 0);
  return dateB - dateA;
});

// Get featured recipes (latest 12)
const featuredRecipes = sortedRecipes.slice(0, 12);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Get featured recipes first (prioritize featured: true)
const featuredMarked = allRecipes
  .filter(r => r.featured === true)
  .sort((a, b) => {
    const dateA = new Date(a.publishedAt || 0);
    const dateB = new Date(b.publishedAt || 0);
    return dateB - dateA;
  });

// If less than 12 featured, fill with latest non-featured recipes
let featuredRecipes = [...featuredMarked];
if (featuredRecipes.length < 12) {
  const nonFeatured = allRecipes
    .filter(r => !r.featured)
    .sort((a, b) => {
      const dateA = new Date(a.publishedAt || 0);
      const dateB = new Date(b.publishedAt || 0);
      return dateB - dateA;
    });
  
  featuredRecipes.push(...nonFeatured.slice(0, 12 - featuredRecipes.length));
}
```

**How It Works:**
1. First, filters all recipes with `featured: true`
2. Sorts featured recipes by publish date (newest first)
3. If less than 12 featured recipes, fills the rest with latest non-featured recipes
4. Always ensures 12 recipes for the homepage (or all available if less)

### **3. Fixed Blog MDXRemote Error**

**Problem:**
```
A component was suspended by an uncached promise. Creating promises inside a Client Component or hook is not yet supported.
```

**Root Cause:**
`MDXRemote` from `next-mdx-remote/rsc` was being used in a Client Component (`BlogDetailClient`), but it must be used in a Server Component.

**Solution:**
Created a separate Server Component for MDX rendering:

**New File:** `src/components/blog/BlogContent.js`
```javascript
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc';

export default async function BlogContent({ content }) {
  return (
    <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none blog-content">
      <MDXRemote source={content} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Updated:** `src/app/blogg/[slug]/page.js`
- Pass `frontmatter`, `content`, and `slug` separately to client component
- Server component handles data fetching

**Updated:** `src/components/blog/BlogDetailClient.js`
- Removed `MDXRemote` import
- Now accepts `frontmatter`, `content`, `slug` as separate props
- Imports and uses `BlogContent` (Server Component) for rendering
- All functionality preserved (animations, parallax, sharing, TOC)

## 🎯 **How to Use the Featured System**

### **To Feature a Recipe:**

1. Open the recipe's MDX file (e.g., `content/recipes/my-recipe.mdx`)
2. Add `featured: true` to the frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "My Amazing Recipe"
   publishedAt: "2024-12-15"
   featured: true    # ← Add this line
   category: "Desserts"
   ---
   ```
3. Save the file
4. The recipe will now appear in the "Nya favoriter att upptäcka" section!

### **To Remove from Featured:**

1. Open the recipe's MDX file
2. Either:
   - Remove the `featured: true` line, OR
   - Change it to `featured: false`
3. Save the file

### **Featured Recipe Order:**

Featured recipes appear sorted by `publishedAt` date (newest first).

To change the order:
- Update the `publishedAt` date in the recipe's frontmatter
- More recent dates appear first

---

## 📊 **Benefits of This System**

### ✅ **Manual Curation**
- Full control over which recipes appear on the homepage
- Not dependent on publish dates alone

### ✅ **Flexible**
- Can feature any recipe regardless of age
- Can have more or less than 6 featured (system adapts)

### ✅ **Automatic Fallback**
- If less than 12 featured recipes exist, system automatically fills with latest non-featured
- Never shows an empty section

### ✅ **Easy to Manage**
- Just add/remove `featured: true` in MDX files
- No code changes needed after setup

### ✅ **Sorted by Date**
- Featured recipes still respect publish dates
- Most recent featured recipes appear first
